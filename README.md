# Technologies Used
## Languages Used
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)


## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

- [Django]()

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - I used jQuery in my Javascript code for the song remixer game. I mostly made use of event handlers to integrate user interaction with the site with my Javascript functions controlling the features offered to the user.
    - jQuery was also used as part of Materialize and is used for Javascript plugins such as the modals.

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts was used to import the 'Montserrat', and 'Tourney' fonts, which were used throughout the site.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Used to source images for the transport section of the remixer.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control using the terminal in Gitpod to 'add' and 'commit' to Git and to push changes to the GitHub repository using 'git push'.

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
    - Gitpod.io was used as the primary development environment when coding for the site. It's terminal was used to preview the site via temporary server, and for version control using Git commands.
- [Github](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub was used to store the code pushed from Gitpod and as deployment for the [published site.](https://timmorrisdev.github.io/MS2-song-remixer/)
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes for the site while in the 'skeleton' stage of my UX process.
- [Autoprefixer](http://autoprefixer.github.io/)
    - Autoprefixer was used in the final stage of development to parse CSS code and add vendor prefixes.
- [Coloors.co](https://coolors.co/)
    - Used to source colour palettes used throughout the site.
- [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#)
    - Used to check responsiveness across different device sizes.

# Testing
## Responsiveness Testing
I used google dev tools throughout the development process to check responsiveness across different screen sizes. 

I was also sure to deploy the site to Heroku early in development to allow for review of the live site on various devices throughout the process.

## W3C Markup, CSS Validation & JSHint Validation
I used the W3C Markup, CSS Validator and JSHint Validator Services to check and validate each page throughout the site to check for errors. 
### [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)
The validator found the following issues for me to address.

### [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
My CSS file style.css passed through the w3 validator with no errors.

### [JSHint Validation Service](https://jshint.com/)
My JavaScript file script.js passed through the validator with no errors. 

### [PEP8 check](http://pep8online.com/checkresult)

Other than those issues, my python code was fully PEP8 compliant.

## Known Bugs / Issues


# Deployment

The project was deployed to Heroku and can be found [here]()


## Forking the repository in GitHub
Forking the repository creates a copy of the original repository in your own account to allow changes to be made without affecting the original repository.
1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the GitHub repository page [here](https://github.com/TimMorrisDev/MS2-song-remixer).
2. In the top-right of the page, below the user avatar, locate the "fork" button.
3. Click the "fork" button and you should now have a copy of the repository in your own account. 

## Making a Local Clone
Details of how to make a local copy of the GutHub repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). To clone using HTTPS follow these steps.
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/TimMorrisDev/MS2-song-remixer).
2. Click the "Code" drop-down menu above the list of files.
3. Copy the HTTPS address to the clipboard using the button provided.
4. Open Terminal.
5. Change the current directory to the location you wish to copy the directory.
6. Type 'git clone' and then paste the HTTPS url you copied earlier. 
7. Press enter and your local clone will be created. 

## Create MongoDB database
My data was stored in a [MongoDB](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) collection set up using the following steps.
- Sign up / Sign In to mongodb and create a new cluster.
- Select 'collections' from the cluster dashboard.
- Click 'create database', and create database name and collection name.
- Click 'create collection' for any additional data collections needed for the app.

## Create Flask Application and install pymongo
In the terminal type the following commands to install the required packages:
    
- Install Flask
    ```
    pip3 install Flask
    ```

- Install PyMongo
    ```
    pip3 install pymongo
    ```
- Install flask-pymongo
    ```
    pip3 install flask-pymongo
    ```
- Install dnspython
    ```
    pip3 install dnspython

Setup app
- Create `app.py` and `env.py` using the terminal
    ```
    touch app.py
    touch env.py
    ```

- Create gitignore file using the terminal to keep `env.py `from being pushed to github
    ```python
    touch env.py
    ```

- Within the gitignore file add `env.py` and `__pycache__/`.
    ```python
    env.py
    __pycache__/
    ```

Set up environment variables and flask instance
- Within `env.py` add the following environment variables:

    ```python
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR SECRET KEY")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR MONGO URI")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "YOUR DATABASE NAME")
    ```

    - I used [randomkeygen]() to generate my secret key. 
    - To get your mongodb URI, go to your cluster dashboard and hit connect. Select your version of python and copy the string to the clipboard.

Within `app.py` import os, Flask and environment variables and create instance of Flask and PyMongo.
```python
    import os
    from flask import Flask
  
    if os.path.exists("env.py"):
        import env
    
    app = Flask(__name__)

    app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_DBNAME")
    app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_URI")
    app.secret_key = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY")

    mongo = PyMongo(app)
```

## Setting up the heroku app
In order to deploy the app via [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), the following steps must be taken. 

- In the terminal, create requirements.txt and Procfile for Heroku to run correctly
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
- Push your files to gitHub
- Navigate to [heroku](https://heroku.com/) and create a new app in your dashboard.
- Assign an app name and region and hit 'create app'.
- In your dashboard, click to connect your gitHub and then locate the correct repository to be deployed.
- Click on the settings tab and then click 'reveal config vars' in order to input the data hidden in `env.py` as follows.
        
        IP                  0.0.0.0
        MONGO.DBNAME        sustainable_supper_club
        MONGO_URI           MONGO URI copied from env.py
        PORT                5000
        SECRET_KEY          SECRET_KEY copied from env.py

- Click 'enable automatic deploy' in the app dashboard.
- Click view to see the deployed site!
